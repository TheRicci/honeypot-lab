## 🤔 Why Wazuh?

Wazuh was chosen as the core SIEM for this stack because it offers several unique advantages:

🖥️ Agent-Based Monitoring
Wazuh provides lightweight agents that run directly on endpoints and containers. These agents collect logs, monitor processes, file integrity, and system activity, giving deep visibility into what’s happening inside the honeypot.

📋 Strong Baseline Detection
In a tightly controlled and fully patched environment, Wazuh can detect deviations from the expected baseline. If a compromise occurs despite all services being up to date, this strongly suggests exploitation of an unknown (0day) vulnerability.

⚡ Real-Time Correlation
The Wazuh Manager correlates data from multiple sources (honeypot logs, IDS alerts, network monitors, and system telemetry) to identify complex attack patterns that individual tools may miss.

🌍 Threat Intelligence Integration
Wazuh supports integration with external threat feeds, allowing correlation between live attacks and known malicious indicators — and extending with custom services like Threat Central in this project.

🔐 Security Ecosystem Compatibility

Built-in support for Suricata, Zeek, and ModSecurity logs

SSL/TLS support for secure communication

Strong API and dashboard for visualization

📊 Open & Extensible
As an open-source SIEM, Wazuh allows full customization of rules, decoders, and alerts, making it ideal for a research-oriented honeypot ecosystem.
